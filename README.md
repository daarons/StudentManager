# StudentManager

StudentManager is a simple CRUD app I made to help manage my ESL students. It takes notes, stores reviews, shows grades over time using line charts to show progress, and imports and exports data.

It was made using JavaFX, Spring, Hibernate, Derby, Log4j, [ExtFX](https://bitbucket.org/sco0ter/extfx), [ControlsFX](https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx/), and [JFXtras](http://jfxtras.org/).
